\section*{Recognition of Service Certificates}
Recognition of service certificates for outgoing ACM Professional chairpersons who have served at least one year in office will be issued free of charge upon written request. Certificates for other officers will be issued on a cost recovery basis. The cost is \$19.00 per certificate. These certificates are signed by the ACM President and Secretary. Send your request to local\_activites@acm.org.

\section*{Depository for Bylaws}
Headquarters coordinates the initial processing of petitions and bylaws for new chapters as well as bylaw amendments with the Membership Services Board, and issues a Certificate of Charter when a chapter is chartered. Copies of each chapter's bylaws are kept on file at Headquarters, and are available upon request.

\section*{Financial Guidance}
Each chapter is required to submit a statement of Cash Receipts and Disbursements every year. The Local Activities Coordinator can answer most general questions about the form, as well as other basic questions regarding financial management. All inquiries from the IRS to the chapter should be directed to the ACM Director of Finance. Any chapter desiring to solicit funds of more than \$5,000 cash or equivalent goods or services from a single source must obtain in advance the approval of ACM's Chief Operations Officer. Solicitations of donations of small magnitude for a specific goal of a specified time do not require approval.
