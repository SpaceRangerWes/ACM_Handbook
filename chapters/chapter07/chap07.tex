\chapter{Special Interest Groups}
\label{chap:SIGs}

\initial{A}CM's Special Interest Groups (SIGs) represent the major areas of the
dynamic computing field.  A primary source of original research and personal
perspectives from the world's leading thinkers in computing and information
technology, they foster technical communities within their respective
specialties across countries and continents.

ACM's SIGs are invested in advancing the skills of their members, keeping them
abreast of emerging trends. They offer opportunities for networking with
colleagues, staying connected to peers and negotiating the strategic challenges
of the digital age.

SIGs drive innovation across a broad spectrum of computing disciplines,
including programming languages, graphics and interactive techniques,
computer-human interaction, data science, mobile communications, artificial
intelligence, education, and theory, among many others. They publish newsletters
and magazines, encourage excellence through multiple recognition programs, and
organize conferences and activities on a local-to-global scale.

\textit{NEVER register a SIG with SILC. NEVER.}
