\chapter{Special Interest Groups}
\label{chap:SIGs}

\initial{A}CM's Special Interest Groups (SIGs) represent the major areas of the dynamic computing field.  A primary source of original research and personal perspectives from the world's leading thinkers in computing and information technology, they foster technical communities within their respective specialties across countries and continents.

ACM's SIGs are invested in advancing the skills of their members, keeping them abreast of emerging trends. They offer opportunities for networking with colleagues, staying connected to peers and negotiating the strategic challenges of the digital age.

SIGs drive innovation across a broad spectrum of computing disciplines, including programming languages, graphics and interactive techniques, computer-human interaction, data science, mobile communications, artificial intelligence, education, and theory, among many others. They publish newsletters and magazines, encourage excellence through multiple recognition programs, and organize conferences and activities on a local-to-global scale.

\textbf{FOR UNITED STATES CHAPTERS:}  The IRS requires chapters operating in the United States to have an Employer Identification Number (EIN). The EIN will serve as proof of a chapter's nonprofit status and allow ACM to include the chapter in our annual group filing with the IRS. ACM will request an EIN on your behalf which you will receive upon chartering.
