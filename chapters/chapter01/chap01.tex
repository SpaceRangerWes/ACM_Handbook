\label{chap:intro}

\initial{W}elcome to the first edition of the University of Kansas ACM Student
Chapter Handbook. This will be your guide on how to best run the ACM Student
Chapter as a member of the Executive Board, herein referred to as the Board, and
ensure its success for now and the years ahead. This handbook is to be passed down
to each new executive board and can be edited and revised as seen fit. However,
this should not apply to official parent organization guidelines, governance,
and bylaws. This chapter has a short history, but it is comprised of very proud
and passionate individuals. Hopefully, these tidbits on the lessons and rules we
learned will help you avoid and learn from our mistakes.

\section{Introduction to Being a Board Member}
\label{sec:sec02}

% Question for Wes
%
% Does the faculty sponsor, as defined as an "Officer" (previously Core Officer)
% need to be present to remove an officer???

Each Board member is to be responsible for their duties outlined in the following
subsections. Clear communication between one another invokes a good understanding.
If for any reason a Board member cannot fulfill their duties, other Board members
may be delegated to support them until said Board member can resume their
responsibilities. Additional Board positions may be added or removed as need be,
including SIG leaders, event coordinators, et cetera. However, the Officers
- defined below - must be present, as dictated by the ACM and the Student
Involvement & Leadership Center, herein referred to as SILC. These are not
removable positions.
\begin{itemize}
	\item ACM@KU shall have four official officer positions, herein referred to as
	 			the Officers, to represent the organization:
				Chair, Vice Chair, Treasurer, and Secretary.
	\item The Officers will be elected each March (maybe moving to December) in a
				specially designated election meeting chosen and publicized in good faith
				by the Board and run by the Chair or by his or her appointed representative.
	\item No Officer may hold more than one office in ACM@KU simultaneously.
	\item All Officers must, upon election, become members of Association for
				Computing Machinery International.
