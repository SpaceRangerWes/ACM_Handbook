\initial{W}elcome to the first edition of the KU ACM Student Chapter Officer's Handbook. This will be your guide on how to best run the ACM Student Chapter and ensure its success for now and the years ahead. This handbook is to be passed down to each new group of officers and can be edited and revised as seen fit. However, this should not apply to official parent organization guidelines, governance, and bylaws. Currently, this chapter has a short history, but it is built of very proud and passionate individuals. Hopefully, these tidbits on the lessons and rules we learned will help you avoid and learn from our mistakes.

\section{Introduction to Being an Officer}
\label{sec:sec01}

Each officer is to be responsible for their duties outlined in the following subsections. Clear communication between one another invokes a good understanding. If for any reason an officer cannot fulfill their duties, you can place these responsibilities on an individual or set of other officers until the said officer can regain control of their full duties. The addition and removal of officer positions is allowed. This can pertain to Special Interest Group (SIG) leaders, ambassador positions, or whatever else is deemed necessary. There is a core officer group that is required by our parent ACM and SILC. These are not removable positions.
